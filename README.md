# Project 0 for Revature training in Java Full-Stack with React

>The project is a console application for a pirate supply store chain. 
Users can register, log in, see the inventory in each of the stores in the 
chain, and complete orders.

>Among the lessons from training we implemented in this project are:

- Many Core Java concepts, including: handling and creating custom 
Exceptions; polymorphism through method overriding, method and constructor 
overloading, and covariance; encapsulation of classes, in particular the 
ones under the models package;java io; static and instance members; reading 
from console using the Scanner class; nested classes; using interfaces to 
define a general set of behaviors that concrete classes implement 
(abstraction);inheritance; packages
- How to create a custom logger that writes to and reads from a file
- Using maven to import and manage dependencies 
- Persistence through Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) with a PostgreSQL 
Driver
- PostgreSQL and DBeaver
- How to create a custom generic ArrayList data structure
- How to create custom tests through the Reflection API
- The implementation of design patterns such as the Data Access Object 
(DAO) pattern, Factory Design Pattern (see ConnectionFactory in utils 
package), Singleton Design Pattern (see CaptainsLogger in utils package)
- Version control using the git tool and both local and remote 
repositories
- Command-line programming and system navigation
- and more...
